SAM (Snoop AddOn Messages) is an addOn for World of Warcraft which prints to a window everything
that's said by you or other players in the "hidden" addon channel in a party,
guild, or in private.

It works with the 3.3.5a version of the client, but it probably works in more
recent or older versions as well.

To use it, enable this addon and create a chat tab (right click the "General"
tab, then "Create New Window") and call it "Snoop". Messages will be shown
there, as long as this tab is kept open.
